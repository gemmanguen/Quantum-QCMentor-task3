# mducng-QCMentor-task3
Quantum computing mentor program
Write script which takes as inputs:

quantum program (e.g. in QASM or QUIL)
errors/noise parameters (coherence time, 1&2 qubit errors, measurement error)
or no errors
and calculates probability of getting a correct result. l

Some requirements:

Use realistic values for the parameters.
You donâ€™t have to support all gates - just enough to run QFT. Test it on QFT (Quantum Programming Studio is a good tool for generating input circuits).
